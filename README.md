Quiz - A coding challenge for [Inkitt](https://www.inkitt.com)
------------------------

### Build a small tool that will do the following:

* Shows to a user a simple Quiz, that has 5 questions as 5 separate pages, shown one after another. 
* Each question will have 2-5 predefined answers that user can pick from, open answers are not possible. 
* No backend for managing questions is needed.
* After the quiz user should see the results page with answers distribution for each question from all users who completed the quiz (answered all 5 questions).
* The user should not be able to access next question without answering current, or going back to previous questions.
* No login for users should be required.
* The user should be able to do the quiz only once (We expect that users always use default browser settings and don't use incognito).


### Requirements:

* Testwork should be done using ruby framework of your choice.
* Any gems are allowed
* Quiz should have backend rendering
* Please try to make the interface as user-friendly as possible
